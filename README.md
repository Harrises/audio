AUDIO INFO

Audio/tech info stuff


POWER SEQUENCE
===============================
1. Board 
Power on board using power switch on wall labeled "board"
2. Snake
Wait for the board to completely "boot up", then power on the equipment rack behind the drumset using the power switch at the top of the rack. There should be a total of 3 green lights that turn on as the 2 digital snakes establish a connection to the board. If these don't light up, simply power off the rack and power it back on again.
3. Amps
The second power switch on the wall by the board turns on the amps. This powers the overhead speakers and the subs.
4. Side/fill speakers
These speakers are powered, so during power-off, it's important to turn these off *before* the snake and board are powered off.

For powering off, reverse this process.
